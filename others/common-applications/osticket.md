# oSTicket

If we come across a customer support portal during our assessment and can submit a new ticket, we may be able to obtain a valid company email address.

Some companies link a ticket number to an email address.

Now, if we log in, we can see information about the ticket and ways to post a reply. If the company set up their helpdesk software to correlate ticket numbers with emails, then any email sent to the email we received when registering, [940288@inlanefreight.local](mailto:940288@inlanefreight.local), would show up here. With this setup, if we can find an external portal such as a Wiki, chat service (Slack, Mattermost, Rocket.chat), or a Git repository such as GitLab or Bitbucket, we may be able to use this email to register an account and the help desk support portal to receive a sign-up confirmation email.
